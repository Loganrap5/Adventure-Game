# Adventure-Game
Repository for my Midterm Adventure Game.
My Midterm is an Adventure Styled game, that features multiple choices to be able to play the game multiple ways. The game will track variables such as Hunger or Thirst, that effects the way the player makes the game. And forces them to change those variables in order to continue through to the end. The game is a Classic Survival Game, where you are forced to survive in nature in order to get rescued at the end.
